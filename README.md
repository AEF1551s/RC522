# Description

Reading RFID card UID using MFRC522 SPI interface and STM32F410RB NUCLEO.

Part of MFRC522 library is rewritten in C from Arduino library - https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid

Uses STM32 GPIO interrupts

  

## Prerequisites

- CMake

-  arm-none-eabi toolchain

-  OpenOCD

  

### Installing prerequisites

#### Ubuntu/Linux

##### CMake

Install build tools and libraries that CMake depends on:  
`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev`  
Go to the temp directory:  
`$ cd /tmp`  
Then, enter the following command to download the source code:  
`$ wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.20.0/cmake-3.20.0.tar.gz`  
Once the tar.gz file is downloaded, enter the following command to extract it:  
`$ tar -zxvf cmake-3.20.0.tar.gz`  
Then move to the extracted folder as follows:  
`$ cd cmake-3.20.0`  
Finally, run the following commands to compile and install CMake:  
`./bootstrap`  
Then  build:  
`$ make`  
And install:  
`$ sudo make install`  
##### arm-none-eabi toolchain  
To install run:  
`$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi`  

##### OpenOCD
Clone OpenOCD repository:  
`$ sudo git clone https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd`  
Run bootsrap:  
`$ ./bootstrap`  
Run configure:  
`$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ --enable-ftdi --enable-stlink --enable-jlink`  
Build:  
`$ make`  
Install:  
`$ sudo make install`  

- OpenOCD requires additional dependecies:  

`build-essentials`  
`libtool`  
`libusb-1.0-0`  
`libusb-1.0-0-dev`  
`gdb-multiarch`  
`libjaylink-dev`  

To install run:  
`$ sudo apt-get install [dependecies]`  

#### Other OS  

See official installation and user guides  

  

## Build  
Go to project directory and create build folder:  
`$ mkdir build`  
Generate Makefiles, example is given with *Unix Makefiles*:  
`$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B ./build`  
Then build project without flashing option:  
`$ cmake -D FLASH=OFF build`  
Run make in /build to compile:  
`$ make`  
  

## Flashing
Flashing is done using OpenOCD. To flash you must specify `-D FLASH=ON` when building the project.  
The openocd command is excecuted as post-build command.  
To change the interface and target configuration, see CMakeLists.txt `openocd_flags`.  
  
 Build project with flashing option:  
`$ cmake -D FLASH=ON build`  
Run make in /build to compile and flash:  
`$ make`  

## Debugging
In this project debugging is done using OpenOCD and with VSCode extensions, for easier visual debugging:  
`Cortex-Debug`  

To see register contents, access serial output and read memory use extensions such as:   
`MemoryView`  
`Peripheral Viewer`  
`Serial Monitor`  

For this to work inside VSCode the *launch* **OpenOCD configuration** and *settings* **cortex-debug** paths must be set.  
For additional debug features, setup VSCode as per **extension setup guides**.

## Reason for porting existing library
RFID card reading requires knowledge of not only SPI communication with PCD, but also extensive knowledge of MIFARE/NFC and ISO standarts that describe RFID card reading etc. 
To understand this more broadly, existing library is rewritten, and then I look back at documentation (PICC selection/ identification flowcharts) to understand why certain steps are performed.  

## Encountered problems and solutions

-  Missing documentation from NXP - about PICC commands and usage -> Use some information from ACS documentation.  
- When flashing, it flashed, but nothing happened -> include startup.c, because OpenOCD starts writing from incorrect address.  
- When debugging no register values and code were visible -> set compiler optimization to 0.
